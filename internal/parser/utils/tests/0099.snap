                The [absent_over_time()](https://prometheus.io/docs/prometheus/latest/querying/functions/#absent_over_time) function is used to check if provided query doesn't match any time series.
                You will only get any results back if the metric selector you pass doesn't match anything.
                Since there are no matching time series there are also no labels. If some time series is missing you cannot read its labels.
                This means that the only labels you can get back from absent call are the ones you pass to it.
                If you're hoping to get instance specific labels this way and alert when some target is down then that won't work, use the `up` metric instead.
