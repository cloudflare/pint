  problem:
    reporter: promql/rate
    summary: chained rate call
    details: You can only calculate `rate()` directly from a counter metric. Calling `rate()` on `sum()` results will return bogus results because `sum()` will hide information on when each counter resets. You must first calculate `rate()` before calling any aggregation function. Always `sum(rate(counter))`, never `rate(sum(counter))`
