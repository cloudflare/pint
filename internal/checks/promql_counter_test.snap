        [Counters](https://prometheus.io/docs/concepts/metric_types/#counter) track the number of events over time and so the value of a counter can only grow and never decrease.
        This means that the absolute value of a counter doesn't matter, it will be a random number that depends on the number of events that happened since your application was started.
        To use the value of a counter in PromQL you most likely want to calculate the rate of events using the [rate()](https://prometheus.io/docs/prometheus/latest/querying/functions/#rate) function, or any other function that is safe to use with counters.
        Once you calculate the rate you can use that result in other functions or aggregations that are not counter safe, like [sum()](https://prometheus.io/docs/prometheus/latest/querying/operators/#aggregation-operators).
