        Prometheus alerting rules will trigger an alert for each query that returns *any* result.
        Unless you do want an alert to always fire you should write your query in a way that returns results only when some condition is met.
        In most cases this can be achieved by having some condition in the query expression.
        For example `up == 0` or `rate(error_total[2m]) > 0`.
        Be careful as some PromQL operations will cause the query to always return the results, for example using the [bool modifier](https://prometheus.io/docs/prometheus/latest/querying/operators/#comparison-binary-operators).
